# ToDo Django
## Hi!
This is my first task app developed with Django so up next i'll show you a little bit of functionality that this app includes.
1. ### Control of my Tasks
In order to develop this minimalist application I've integrated the control of your Tasks. With ToDo Django you will be able to:
- Add a new task and which will be automatically displayed with its respective date of created, name and its description.
- Edit any of your tasks either rename them or change its description.
- Ofcourse delete them. 

2. ### Register
If you don't have a user to record your tasks, you can create a new one and start adding tasks to your timeline

3. ### Forgot your password?

Don't worry, I got you! passwords can be sometimes difficult to remember if you have multiple accounts on the internet. So if you forget the one you were using with ToDo Django you can create a new one on the login page.

## That's it!

Thank you for using ToDo Django
